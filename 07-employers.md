## Employer support that’s practical, structured, and outcome-focused

Hiring and training decisions get expensive when expectations aren’t clear. We support employers by bringing structure to the process — from defining roles to planning training pathways — so you can move faster and reduce costly mis-hires.

**What you get from us**
- Clear role requirements (skills, responsibilities, and success criteria)
- A hiring plan that matches your timeline and budget
- Outsourcing & remote-work planning when it makes sense
- Training and upskilling pathways for new hires and current staff

## 1) Hiring support

### Role clarity (before posting the job)
We help you define the role in a way that attracts the right candidates and filters out mismatches early.

**We help you document**
- Core responsibilities (what the person will do weekly)
- Must-have skills vs. nice-to-have skills
- Tools/software used (e.g., Excel, QuickBooks, CRM, scheduling tools)
- Experience requirements (what truly matters vs. inflated requirements)
- What success looks like in the first **30 / 60 / 90 days**

### Screening & selection structure
You don’t need complicated HR systems — you need consistent evaluation.

**We can support**
- Resume screening criteria (simple scorecard)
- Interview question sets aligned with job outcomes
- Short practical tasks (role-based, not gimmicky)
- Final selection framework (reduces “gut-feel” hiring)

### Hiring plan & onboarding readiness
A great hire can still fail without a clear start plan.

**We help you set up**
- Day 1 checklist and access/tools readiness
- First-week priorities (training + deliverables)
- Manager check-in cadence (weekly structure)
- Early performance expectations (measurable, fair)

## 2) Outsourcing & remote work planning

Outsourcing and remote hiring can be powerful — but only when the work is clearly defined and the workflow is secure and measurable.

### When outsourcing makes sense
Outsourcing can be a good fit for work that is:
- Process-driven and repeatable
- Trackable with clear outputs
- Not dependent on constant in-person interaction

**Examples**
- Admin support and back-office tasks  
- Documentation, formatting, reporting preparation  
- Scheduling coordination and process support  
*(exact fit depends on your business model and compliance needs)*

### Remote team setup (simple but effective)
We help you plan an approach that prevents the usual problems (miscommunication, missed deadlines, unclear ownership).

**We support**
- Defining deliverables and timelines
- Setting communication rhythm (weekly priorities + updates)
- Clear ownership: who does what, and who approves
- Basic tooling guidance (shared docs, task lists, file organization)

### Quality control without micromanaging
You should be able to measure output without constant supervision.

**We help you implement**
- Output standards (templates, checklists)
- Review checkpoints (what gets reviewed and when)
- Escalation path (what to do when something is off)

## 3) Training & upskilling pathways

Training works best when it’s tied to job outcomes — not random courses.

### Upskilling plan for new hires
We build a simple pathway that answers:
- What should they learn first?
- What tools/processes matter most?
- What does “ready to work independently” mean?

**Typical pathway structure**
1) Orientation + tools access  
2) Shadowing + guided tasks  
3) Independent tasks with review  
4) Performance milestones (30/60/90 days)

### Upskilling plan for existing staff
When you want staff to grow into higher responsibility roles, we can help plan:
- Skills needed for the next level
- Training sequence (what first, what later)
- Milestones and measurable outcomes

## How engagement typically works

1) **Discovery call** (your goals, timeline, roles, constraints)  
2) **Role & workflow clarity** (responsibilities, deliverables, success metrics)  
3) **Action plan** (hiring / outsourcing / training steps)  
4) **Implementation support** (templates + next-step coordination)
