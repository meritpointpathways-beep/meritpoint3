<!-- (3) FAQ -->
<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Do you charge any fees upfront?</h3>
<p>
No. We start with a <strong>free consultation</strong>. If you need help beyond that, we’ll explain options clearly before anything.
</p>

<p>
OSAP outcomes depend on eligibility and program details. Many learners plan around categories like tuition, books/supplies, and program fees.
We can explain what applies to your situation and what to prepare.
</p>

<p>
Not at all. Many people come to us unsure. We’ll start with your goals and background and shortlist practical options.
</p>

<p>
It depends on intake dates and what documents are needed. In your consultation, we’ll map out a realistic timeline and next steps.
</p>
